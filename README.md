# Ares ERC20 token contract

This is the ERC20 contract of the ares token deployed on BSC. 
The token is mintable because, at the moment, we don't 
know if the token will have some other function in the future.
We have created this token, to fundrise the project 
and continuing to develop all the athena ecosystem explained in the whitepaper.

At the moment we are implementing the MVP of the platform and 
meanwhile we are continuing with the community growth.

If you are interested to join with us, 
you can contact us on social media or via email.

All our contacts are shown on our website: https://athenblockchain.io
